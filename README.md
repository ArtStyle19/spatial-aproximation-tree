# Spatial Approximation Tree (SA-Tree) ‚Äî Visual Demo & Range Search

This repository contains a minimal **C++/OpenGL** visualization and a toy implementation of a **Spatial Approximation Tree (SA-tree)** with a simple **range query** (click-to-search) over a 2D point set.

It‚Äôs intended as a **learning and demo tool** that ties the classic SA-tree / DSA-tree papers to a working, visual example.

> SA-trees _‚Äúapproach‚Äù_ the query spatially instead of dividing the space.  
> They‚Äôre effective **metric indexes** especially when **selectivity is low** or the space is **hard to split**.  
> **Dynamic SA-trees (DSA-trees)** extend SA-trees with **insertions/deletions** and often improve search performance in practice.

## What this project shows

- A small **point set** (`{x, y}` pairs) rendered on a **1000√ó1000 grid**.
- A **tree** built from those points (**root + children edges**, color-coded by depth).
- **Range search**: left-click anywhere to draw a search circle (`r = 200`) and print to `stdout` the points found within that radius using a simple **cover-radius pruning**.
- A **compact, readable codebase** you can tweak to reproduce examples and ideas from the SA-tree / DSA-tree literature.

## Background: SA-tree & DSA-tree in two minutes

- **SA-tree (Spatial Approximation Tree):**  
  An index for **metric spaces** (any distance obeying triangle inequality).  
  Searching proceeds by **approaching the query** from selected representatives (nodes) and using **triangle inequality** to prune away regions.  
  SA-trees often give **sublinear search** (measured in distance evaluations) and perform well for **hard spaces / low selectivity queries**.

- **DSA-tree (Dynamic SA-tree):**  
  Supports **insertions** and **deletions** efficiently.  
  Surprisingly, in many cases **dynamic SA-trees are faster than static SA-trees** because incremental insertions lead to better-balanced structures.

## How the algorithm here works

This demo follows the **spirit** of SA-trees while keeping the code compact for visualization:

### 1. Root choice

- Currently hard-coded to the **4th point** (`rando = 3`), then removed from `S`.

### 2. Neighbor selection & children assignment

- For the active node `a`, the remaining points are **sorted by distance to `a`**.
- A list `N_a` of **neighbors** is built greedily:
  - a candidate `v` becomes a neighbor unless it‚Äôs **closer to an already chosen neighbor** than to `a`.
- Points not absorbed by any neighbor are attached as **children** of the closest node in `N_a`  
  _(in the current code: ‚Äúclosest to `a`‚Äù heuristic)_.

### 3. Covering radius

- `a->R` is updated as the **max distance** from `a` to any point considered at this stage‚Äîused for **pruning**.

### 4. Recursive construction

- For each `b ‚àà N_a`, we form a subset `S_b = { v : d(v, b) < d(v, a) }` and recurse, linking `b` as a child of `a`.

### 5. Range search

- DFS from the root:
  - A node is **reported** if `d(node, q) ‚â§ r`.
  - A child subtree is **explored** if `d(child, q) ‚â§ r + child->R`.
- This is a standard **triangle-inequality pruning** idea in metric indexes.

## Interesting stuff (tips, gotchas, and lesser-known insights)

- **They‚Äôre ‚Äúapproach-based,‚Äù not partition-based.**  
  SA-trees **walk toward the query** using triangle inequality to prune, often beating partition structures when the space is **tough** or queries are **broad**.  
  ‚Üí This is why they can be **best-in-class on ‚Äúhard‚Äù datasets**.

- **When _not_ to use it:**
  - If you have **low-dimensional Euclidean data** with rectangles (e.g., GIS), an **R-tree** variant may be simpler.
  - If you need **billion-scale vector ANN** with strict latency (e.g., recommender systems), specialized ANN methods (**HNSW**, **IVF**, etc.) will dominate.
  - SA/DSA shines in **general metric settings** where ANN assumptions don‚Äôt hold.
